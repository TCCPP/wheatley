This repository contains the source code for the Wheatley bot, made for the Together C & C++ discord
server.

This bot is primary internal moderation and administrative tools, such as tracking server
suggestions and addressing bot raids and scammers. Scams and bot raids usually are not targeted, but
the exact techniques and heuristics used to identify raids are, at least for now, omitted from the
public mirror for this repository. The mirror pulls new changes daily.
