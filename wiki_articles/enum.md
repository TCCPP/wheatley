# Scoped and Unscoped Enumerations

In C++, `enum` introduces an
[unscoped enumeration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum#Unscoped_enumerations),
and `enum class` or `enum struct` introduce a
[scoped enumeration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum#Scoped_enumerations).
```cpp
enum class Fruit : char {
    NONE, // enumerator-list, NONE = 0
    APPLE = 'a',
    BANANA = 'b'
};
Fruit apple = Fruit::APPLE;
```

## Scoped Enumeration (C++-only)
- underlying type is `int`
- requires *enum-name::* to access
- only `=`, `==` and `!=` defined (operator overloading possible)

<!-- inline -->
## Unscoped Enumeration
- underlying type is impl.-defined
- access without *enum-name*
- behaves like list of constants in surrounding scope
- inherits ops. from underlying type
