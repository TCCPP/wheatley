# How to Format Code on Discord

- type three "backticks" (not quotes/apostrophes, on QWERTY layout, left of `1`-key)
- on the same line, type the file extension for that language (`c` or `cpp`)
- enter your code on a new line and put another three backticks at the end

## [Example Input]
\`\`\`cpp
int main() {
    return 0;
}
\`\`\`

## [Example Output]
```cpp
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```
