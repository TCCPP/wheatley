# The difficulty in helping with competitive coding problems

Something that is often underestimated, is how difficult it be to help with competitive programming, This macro aims to explain, **why** it's difficult to help with these questions and what you can do to make it **easier** to get your question answered.

## How challenges are structured

Competitive programming challenges are often formed around pretty arbitrary set of rules and requirements, that involve the helper to get deeply involved in the problem to even understand the scope of the problem, this means there is often a very high bar for helpers to even be able to help you as they need to fully understand the problems and any restrictions

## Hidden test cases

Due to the competitive nature it's not uncommon for test cases to be hidden to prevent for example hardcoding an edge case in your code rather then properly fixing the code, however this makes the ability to help with these questions significantly harder due to helpers being unable to narrow down where issues occur.

## TLE (time limit exceeded)

It's very common to run into a TLE case, and this can be rather confusing for beginners, the question is often "how do I make this faster?". Performance in general is a very difficult topic and it's often hard to pinpoint exactly where performance issues in your code are. Often the reason for TLE is that your algorithm is not efficient enough, and it's often hard to know if your current algorithm is appropriate without understanding the complete scope of the problem, what can boil down to helpers needing to solve the question themselves to be able to fully grasp this scope.

## Common styling

due to competitive nature, a very specific coding "style" has emerged in this specific programming nice, This is often full of hacks, aliases, 1-3 letter variables / acronyms, sparse or bad formatting, making code extremely difficult to parse for people to understand the code. And if they can't understand the code helping becomes even more difficult.

## How to get the best possible help

- Format your code, This can include giving your variables proper names, adding spaces and newlines, really anything to make the code easier to understand.
- Try to narrow the problem down as much as possible, The more specific your question is the easier it is to help. For example if you experience a TLE, try to find the offending area so we can narrow down on that.
- Ask a good question.
- Avoid screenshots in your question, they are hard to read for textual information.
