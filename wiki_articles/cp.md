# The Difficulty in Helping with Competitive Coding Problems

Please understand competitive programming (CP) questions are hard to help with because:

- Understanding requires getting into solving the question itself.
- Test cases are hidden, so no starting point to find out what is wrong.
- Your solution code is probably not written for others to easily read.

## How to Get the Best Possible Help?

What you can do to get the best possible help:

- Format your code, this includes giving meaningful names to things.
- Narrow down the problem, then ask a detailed, on-point question.
- Avoid screenshots of the question, give links or paste the question as text.

## Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)

What about "Time limit exceeded" (TLE)?
The only thing we can say is that your solution is not efficient enough. Finding such a sufficient solution is part of solving the CP question itself. Sometimes a helper knows and can hint you about the solution, but it's you who is supposed to come up with it.
