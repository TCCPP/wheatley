# The difficulty in helping with competitive coding problems

Competitive programming problems are difficult to help with. The often require helpers to get very involved in problems, even taking the time to solve the problem themselves, and often also boil down to the person asking the question not having thought through the problem enough themselves to understand the complete.

When asking a programming question, it's important to make the effort required for helpers as minimal as possible. 

## How challenges are structured

Competitive programming challenges often have arbitrary rules and requirements that require helpers to get deeply involved to even understand the problem.

## Hidden test cases

Test cases are often hidden to prevent, for example, hardcoding an edge case in your code rather then properly fixing the code. Without effort from the learner to find edge cases it's difficult for helpers to narrow down where issues occur.

## TLE (time limit exceeded)

TLE failures are common and can be rather confusing for beginners. The question is often "how do I make this faster?". Often the reason for TLE is that your algorithm is not efficient enough, and it's often hard to know if your current algorithm is appropriate.

## Common styling

A very specific coding "style" has emerged in this specific programming niche. This is often full of hacks, aliases, 1-3 letter variables / acronyms, sparse or bad formatting, making code extremely difficult to parse for people to understand the code. And if they can't understand the code helping becomes even more difficult.

## How to get the best possible help

- Format your code, this can include giving your variables proper names, adding spaces and newlines, really anything to make the code easier to understand.
- Try to narrow the problem down as much as possible. For example if you experience a TLE, try to find the offending area so we can narrow down on that.
- Ask a good question.
- Avoid screenshots in your question, they are hard to read for textual information.
