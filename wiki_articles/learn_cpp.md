# How to Learn C++ Programming

We generally recommend a good book to learn the necessary fundamentals:
- [Murach’s C++ Programming](https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-c-programming-2nd-edition-detail)
- [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://stroustrup.com/programming.html)
- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)

To actually write and run C++ code, you will need a compiler, editor, and debugger.
We *strongly* recommend to start out using an IDE, which will provide all these tools for you:
