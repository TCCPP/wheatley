recommended.

## What to Post
State your problem clearly and provide all necessary details:
- the relevant portion of your code, or all of it
- the expected output
- the actual output (or the **full** error)<br>
:trophy: **Gold Standard:** Minimal Reproducible Example

<!-- inline -->
## Where to Post
Provide the relevant code in the message, and format it nicely with a code block\*.
If it's too much for one message, you can upload it:
- [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) for most C/C++ snippets
- [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) for interaction, debugging<br>
:no_entry: **Do not post screenshots, let alone photos of your screen!**

* Use /code if you don't know how to format code blocks
