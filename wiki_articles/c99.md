# Using C99 Features

C99, i.e. the [C standard released in 1999][1] added [a lot of features][2] that make C code much more readable.
Examples include:

**[Declarations anywhere in block](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/declarations#Notes)**<br>
In C99, you can declare and initialize a variable anywhere: `int x = 3;`
Declare variables where they can be initialized; don't put all variables at the top of a function.

**[Declaration in for loop init-clause](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/for)**<br>
In C99, you can write `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`.
This is ideal when `i` is only needed inside the loop.

**[Compound Literals](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/compound_literal) and
[Designated Initializers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/struct_initialization)**<br>
In C99, you can assign a `struct` like:
```c
p = (struct point) {.x = 3, .y = 5};
```

**[_Bool](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/arithmetic_types#Boolean_type) and the
[convenience alias bool](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/boolean)**<br>
In C99, you can use `_Bool` instead of `int` for variables which can only be `true` or `false`.
`#include <stdbool.h>` for the `bool` convenience alias.
