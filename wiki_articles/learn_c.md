# How to Learn C Programming

We generally recommend a good book to learn the necessary fundamentals:
- [C Programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/)
- [The C Programming Language (K&R)](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/c-programming-language/P200000000368/9780131103627)
- [Harvard CS50 course](http://cs50.edx.org/)
- [learn-c.org](https://www.learn-c.org/)

To actually write and run C code, you will need a compiler, editor, and debugger.
We *strongly* recommend to start out using an IDE, which will provide all these tools for you:
