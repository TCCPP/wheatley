# When Do We Need a Virtual Destructor?

[As stated by the C++ standard](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4868/expr.delete#3), when we `delete` a `base*`
which is actually pointing to a `derived` which inherits from `base`, `base` must have a virtual destructor. Otherwise,
the behaviour is undefined.

```c
struct base {
  // make base a virtual class
  virtual void dummy() {}
  // virtual ~base() = default; uncomment to fix
};
struct derived : base {
  std::string str;
};
int main() {
  base* b = new derived{"awoo"};
  delete b; // undefined behaviour
}
```

The problem is that `derived` has a `str` member. When we `delete b`, this calls the destructor of `base`, because `p`
is `base*`, but `~base()` doesn't call `~derived()`, so `str` is leaked.
