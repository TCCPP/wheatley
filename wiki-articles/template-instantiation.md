# What Is Template Instantiation?

Templates are not real entities until a piece of code uses them with arguments. When this happens, the compiler replaces
the template parameters with the provided arguments, deriving the generic code into specific code.

The generic code needs to be available in any translation unit that uses it. This is why templates are typically
declared **and** defined entirely in headers.

<!-- inline -->

## Template function

```cpp
template<typename T>
void print(T arg) {
    std::cout<<arg<<' ';
}
```

<!-- inline -->

## Usage

```cpp
print(42);
print("Hello");
```

## Substitution

On the first call to `print`, the compiler substitutes `T` for `int` in the template code, _instantiating_ it into a new
function. The second call to `print` causes `T` to be substituted for `const char*`, instantiating the template again.

Here, `T` is said to be _deduced_: the compiler infers `T` from the type of the argument to `print`.

**Output:**

```
42 Hello
```
