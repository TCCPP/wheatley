# What Is `std::array` And Why Should I Use It?

C-style arrays have important shortcomings:<br/>

:no_entry: cannot be returned from functions<br> :no_entry: cannot be assigned with `=`<br> :no_entry: cannot be
compared with `==`, `<` etc. (it'd be pointer comparison)<br> :no_entry: can only be initialized via `""`, `{}`, or
_[default initialization][1]_<br> :warning: might implicitly [decay to pointers][2]; C arrays are not passed by value to
functions<br> :warning: might be [variable-length arrays][3] (VLAs), if the developer makes a mistake

**[std::array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array)** is a standard library container and
_[aggregate type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization)_ which solves these problems.
Usually, it's implemented along the lines of:

```cpp
template <typename T, size_t N>
struct array {
    T content[N]; // and other members ...
};
```

## Example Usage

```cpp
int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3 };              // turns into ...
std::array<int, 3> arr = { 1, 2, 3 }; // or ...
std::array arr = { 1, 2, 3 };         // (CTAD, since C++17)
```
