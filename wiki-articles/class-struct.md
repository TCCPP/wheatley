# What Is the Difference Between class and struct?

The keywords **[class][class]** and **[struct][struct]** both declare a so-called _[class type][classtype]_. The
declared class will have different properties, such as default [member access][access], depending on whether `class` or
`struct` was used.

## `class`

- members `private` by default
- `private` [inheritance](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/derived_class) from base class by default
- incompatible with C
- typically used for larger classes

<!-- inline -->

## `struct`

- members `public` by default
- `public` [inheritance](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/derived_class) from base class by default
- compatible with C
- typically used for [aggregates](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization),
  [traits](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/type_traits)
