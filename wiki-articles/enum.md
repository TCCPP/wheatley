# Scoped and Unscoped Enumerations

In C++, `enum` introduces an [unscoped enumeration][enum], and `enum class` or `enum struct` introduce a [scoped
enumeration][enumclass].

```cpp
enum class Fruit : char {
    NONE, // enumerator-list, NONE = 0
    APPLE = 'a',
    BANANA = 'b'
};
Fruit apple = Fruit::APPLE;
```

## Scoped Enumeration (C++-only)

- underlying type is `int`
- requires _enum-name::_ to access
- only `=`, `==` and `!=` defined (operator overloading possible)

<!-- inline -->

## Unscoped Enumeration

- underlying type is impl.-defined
- access without _enum-name_
- behaves like list of constants in surrounding scope
- inherits ops. from underlying type
