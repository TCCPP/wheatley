# Large Language Models (LLMs)

We **highly** recommend against the use of LLMs and AI assistants because:
- LLMs are bad at C and C++
- LLMs are wrong more often than not
- LLMs answer with complete confidence even when wrong
- If you're new to C++ you likely don't know enough to know when answers are wrong
