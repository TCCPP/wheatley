# C vs. C++: Which Is Better, Faster, ...?

Neither language is better, neither language is faster. There are good reasons for using both languages:

## Reasons to Use C

:white_check_mark: relatively low-level language<br> :white_check_mark: much simpler language (no classes, templates,
...)<br> :white_check_mark: portable to a wide variety of systems

<!-- inline -->

## Reasons to Use C++

:white_check_mark: lots of helpful abstractions (classes, templates, ...)<br> :white_check_mark: feature-rich language
(function overloads, `constexpr`, ...)<br> :white_check_mark: extensive standard library

## Which Is Faster?

Neither language is inherently faster than the other. In modern compilers, the exact same optimizer is used for both
languages. Certain high-level C++ features can make it easy to inadvertently write inefficient code (e.g. innocent
looking code performing large copies).

One notable difference between the two languages is their standard libraries' string representation: C strings, while
simple, are highly inefficient because they are terminated by a null character, therefore needing to walk the whole
string to find out its length.

## Conclusion

Both languages can be equally fast, choose the right language for your job, and the language you enjoy working in.
