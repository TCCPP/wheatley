# Choosing an IDE/Editor

There is no "best" editor for C/C++. Each has its strengths and weaknesses.

## IDEs (Integrated Dev. Envs.)

Specialized editors with built-in tools for building, running, debugging, etc. Heavier, but also much more powerful out
of the box.

- **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)** (free, Windows)
- **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** (free, macOS)
- **[Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you)** (free, any OS)
- **[CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/)** (free for students, open-source, any OS)
- **[repl.it](https://replit.com/)** (free for open-source, in-browser)

## Code Editors

Less language-specific editors, which are more lightweight. Extra tools for building, running, etc. can be installed via
plugins.

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)** (free, any OS)
- **[Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com)** (free, any OS)
- **[Vim](https://www.vim.org)**, **[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)**,
  **[Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io)**: (free, terminal)

All the above work for many languages, not just C/C++.

## More Alternatives

You can use practically any text editor, even Notepad to write your code. C and C++ can be compiled and run directly
from the command line. However, this setup is difficult to use and to make as powerful as an IDE.
